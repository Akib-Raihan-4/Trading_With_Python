    "## Deviation form normality.\n",
    "Basically it is saying that most of the time the actual time series on different assest classes are actually <br>\n",
    "not normally ditributed, hence normal assumption is just a **simplifying** assumption.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem with the Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "The real world is more complex. Actual investment returns, especially in stocks or hedge funds, don't always<br> behave like the simple bell curve suggests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extreme Returns in Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In a perfect world (normal distribution assumption), extreme positive or negative returns are very rare.<br> It's like saying, \"I expect to never see really big gains or losses.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reality Check - Actual Returns:\n",
    "    - When we look at actual investment returns, they can be way bigger (both good and bad) than what<br> the simple assumption predicts.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Underestimating Extreme Events:\n",
    "    - The assumption of a normal distribution underestimates the chances and sizes of really big positive or negative returns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Introducing Skewness and Kurtosis:\n",
    "    - To better understand real-world returns, we introduce two concepts:\n",
    "        - **Skewness**: Measures how lopsided the distribution is.\n",
    "        - **Kurtosis**: Measures how thick or thin the tails of the distribution are.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Negatively Skewed Distributions:\n",
    "    - If returns are negatively skewed, it means there's a higher chance of really bad outcomes.\n",
    "    - When the mean (average) is less than the median, it signals negative skewness.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Volatility and Risk:\n",
    "    - Volatility is a common measure of risk.\n",
    "    - In negatively skewed distributions, relying only on volatility might make the risk seem less than<br> it actually is, especially for extreme negative returns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Reality Check - Hedge Fund Returns:\n",
    "    - Looking at actual hedge fund returns, we often see negative skewness and high kurtosis,<br> indicating a higher chance of extreme negative returns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Statistical Test - Jarque-Bera Test:\n",
    "    - The Jarque-Bera test helps us statistically check if a distribution is significantly<br>\n",
    "     different from the normal distribution.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Conclusion:\n",
    "    - Most investment returns don't fit the simple normal distribution assumption.\n",
    "    - Assuming normal distribution can be a big oversimplification, especially because extreme events<br>\n",
    "     happen more often than predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kurtosis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kurtosis is like looking at the tails of a distribution\n",
    "- If the distribution has fat tails, it means extreme events are more common.\n",
    "- If the tails are skinny, it means most values are close to the average, and extreme values are rare.\n",
    "- Understanding kurtosis helps us grasp how likely we are to see really high or really low values in a dataset.\n"
