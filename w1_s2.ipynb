    "## Deviation form normality.\n",
    "Basically it is saying that most of the time the actual time series on different assest classes are actually <br>\n",
    "not normally ditributed, hence normal assumption is just a **simplifying** assumption.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem with the Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "The real world is more complex. Actual investment returns, especially in stocks or hedge funds, don't always<br> behave like the simple bell curve suggests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extreme Returns in Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In a perfect world (normal distribution assumption), extreme positive or negative returns are very rare.<br> It's like saying, \"I expect to never see really big gains or losses.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reality Check - Actual Returns:\n",
    "    - When we look at actual investment returns, they can be way bigger (both good and bad) than what<br> the simple assumption predicts.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Underestimating Extreme Events:\n",
    "    - The assumption of a normal distribution underestimates the chances and sizes of really big positive or negative returns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Introducing Skewness and Kurtosis:\n",
    "    - To better understand real-world returns, we introduce two concepts:\n",
    "        - **Skewness**: Measures how lopsided the distribution is.\n",
    "        - **Kurtosis**: Measures how thick or thin the tails of the distribution are.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Negatively Skewed Distributions:\n",
    "    - If returns are negatively skewed, it means there's a higher chance of really bad outcomes.\n",
    "    - When the mean (average) is less than the median, it signals negative skewness.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Volatility and Risk:\n",
    "    - Volatility is a common measure of risk.\n",
    "    - In negatively skewed distributions, relying only on volatility might make the risk seem less than<br> it actually is, especially for extreme negative returns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Reality Check - Hedge Fund Returns:\n",
    "    - Looking at actual hedge fund returns, we often see negative skewness and high kurtosis,<br> indicating a higher chance of extreme negative returns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Statistical Test - Jarque-Bera Test:\n",
    "    - The Jarque-Bera test helps us statistically check if a distribution is significantly<br>\n",
    "     different from the normal distribution.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Conclusion:\n",
    "    - Most investment returns don't fit the simple normal distribution assumption.\n",
    "    - Assuming normal distribution can be a big oversimplification, especially because extreme events<br>\n",
    "     happen more often than predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kurtosis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kurtosis is like looking at the tails of a distribution\n",
    "- If the distribution has fat tails, it means extreme events are more common.\n",
    "- If the tails are skinny, it means most values are close to the average, and extreme values are rare.\n",
    "- Understanding kurtosis helps us grasp how likely we are to see really high or really low values in a dataset.\n"

    "## Downside Risk Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semi-Deviation** is the *volatility* of the *sub-sample* of **below average** or **below zero** returns\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Recognizes that investors are more concerned about uncertainty or volatility on the downside.\n",
    "    - It is a measure of volatility that considers only the outcomes below the mean or zero.\n",
    "    - Focuses on losses rather than gains.\n",

    "2. Value at Risk(VaR):\n",
    "    - Aims to estimate the maximum loss that can occur to a portfolio with a given probability.\n",
    "    - Defined at a specified confidence level, such as 99%, indicating the worst possible outcome after excluding<br> a certain percentage of extreme losses (e.g., 1%).\n",
    "    - VaR is expressed as a positive number and represents the magnitude of the maximum loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question:* Consider the following sequence of monthly returns on a portfolio:  -4%, +5%, +2%, -7%, +1%, +0.5%,<br> -2%, -1%, -2%, +5%.What is the 90% monthly VaR for the portfolio? <br><br>\n",
    "*Answer:* Out of 10 monthly returns, the worst outcome is -7%, so 1 out of 10 returns is equal to -7%, and 9 out <br> of ten are better than -7%. The worst return after excluding the 10% worst return, that is after excluding the worst return, is<br> therefore -4%. VaR is typically expressed as a positive number (-4% means 4% loss): so 4% is the worst loss after excluding the 10% worst losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Beyond Value at Risk or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR):\n",
    "    - Recognizes that what happens beyond VaR may be of greater concern to investors.\n",
    "    - CVaR is the expected loss beyond the VaR threshold.\n",
    "    - It provides insight into the average loss in the tail of the distribution beyond the VaR.\n",
    "    - Expressed as a positive number, representing the magnitude of the expected loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question:* Consider the following sequence of monthly returns on a portfolio:  -4%, +5%, +2%, -7%, +1%, +0.5%,<br> -2%, -1%, -2%, +5%. What is the 80% monthly CVaR for the portfolio? <br><br>\n",
    "*Answer:* Out of 10 monthly returns, the worst outcome is -7% and the second worst outcome is -4%, so<br> 8 out of 10 outcomes are better than -4%. The worst return after excluding the 20% worst return, that is after excluding the two<br> worst return, is therefore -2%. VaR is typically expressed as a positive number so 2% is the 80% VaR. The CVaR is given by the average<br> loss beyond the VaR, that is -(-7%-4%)/2=5.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**VaR and CVaR provide meaningful indicators to estimate the maximum loss and expected loss beyond a certain confidence level.**"
